# Redux Employee Salary Mongoose Conversion

Now that we know about MongoDB, let's put it into action. Replace Postgres in this React-Redux app with Mongo/Mongoose!

## Setup

1. Fork this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`


## Base Goals

1. Update all of the server routes to use `Mongoose` instead of `pg`. Including a `Schema` for our Employees.
    - [ ] GET
    - [ ] POST
    - [ ] DELETE
2. Create a `PUT` route that updates a given employee to have an annual salary of $57,000. This can be hard-coded.


## Stretch Goals

1. We know better at this point. Redux and async calls don't mix well. 
    - Add Sagas into the mix! Practice makes perfect!
